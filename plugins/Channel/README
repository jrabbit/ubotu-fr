This plugin protect channel against differents kind of attacks:

Check http://coevoet.fr for more information


 * flood : a lot of message from same user in few seconds
 * low flood : client schedule message, so that bypass flood protection
 * repeat : avoid useless repeat message or sentence with a lof of same chars
 * join/part/quit flood : that's handle Excess Flood, netsplit, cloak changes
 * channel notices
 * ban evasion with gateway/web
 * abuse of colors, capslocks, chars flood
 * follow bad user, and take action if necessary
 * handle banned cloaked user who joined before be identified
 * command flood : the bot will autoignore the command in the channel.
 * massjoin : the bot will put some modes if massjoin is detect ( understand netsplit )
 * detect clone attacks

the plugin use a database for tracking bans, and another one, per channel to store regexps

with bantracker you can !bansearch, 
!banedit the duration of an active, take info about one ban !baninfo, 
or see logs of affected users !banlog

Regular expression are supported for most common irc events

The owner of the bot must add bot's hostmask as owner's hostmask : 
in private query with your bot : !hostmask add botnickname!botident@bothost

This plugin must be use with such setting :

    supybot.databases.plugins.channelSpecific: True
    
in others case, you must !reload Channel each time you add or remove regexp.

The bot works better with channel mode +z, and of course with a logChannel and opChannel.

Each time you change conf settings related to Channel, globaly,
you must reload Channel, if it's a channel specific config, 
a !restorechan #channel is enough

this version of supybot support all kind of list of a channel ( +e,+I,+q,+b ) of ircd-seven
so you can use it as base to create your own plugin with some extras features:

like irc.state.channels[channel].quiets, irc.state.channels[channel].exempts etc ..

if you need help with this plugin or this version of supybot, 
feel free to query me on freenode network, 
my nick is 'niko'

to have a fast and robust bot,
i used these settings :

supybot.networks.freenode.password: accountname:password
supybot.networks.freenode.servers: barjavel.freenode.net:7000 ( you must target a specific server if you want to use ssl )
supybot.networks.freenode.ssl: True
supybot.reply.format.time: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
supybot.reply.format.time.elapsed.short: True
supybot.reply.whenNotCommand: False

supybot.capabilities: -list -admin -trusted -register -help -config misc.ping -alias.remove -owner -alias.add
supybot.databases.plugins.channelSpecific: True

some examples with regexp:

!regadd #channel /hello/ @ channel private $channel $nick: Hello o/
!onjoin #channel // @ channel private $channel hello $nick !

if you want to use more complicated regexp, keep in mind to quote your 
regexp to avoid the bot to understand that as pipe syntaxe or nested command :

!onnick "/(away$|brb$|afk$)/" @ channel fpart $channel $nick Read topic, and use /away & /back

!warn "/fuck/" @ 1 channel private $channel $nick: language.
!warn "/fuck/" @ 2 channel kick $channel $nick: last warning.
!warn "/fuck/" @ 3 channel kban $channel $nick 1h you have been warned

for each kind of regexp, you can use $channel, $nick, $hostmask, $mask, $randomNick, $text
