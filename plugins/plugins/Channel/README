This plugin will allow you to track bans, use regexps etc

The owner of the bot must add bot's hostmask as owner's hostmask : 
in private query with your bot : !hostmask add botnickname!botident@bothost

any time you modify config, like : 
!config channel #mychannel supybot.plugins.Channel.floodCheck True
you must do !restorechan #mychannel to apply change

this version of supybot support all kind of list of a channel ( +e,+I,+q,+b ) of ircd-seven

so you can use it as base to create your own plugin with some extras features:

like irc.state.channels[channel].quiets, or irc.state.channels[channel].exempts etc ..
